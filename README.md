# Coco - 2014 Dataset
## Scene understanding
- recognize what objects are present
- localizing the objects in 2D and in 3D
- determining the objects' and scene's attributes
- characterizing the relationship between objects
- provide a semantic description of the scene


what is the best dataset for scene understanding?

### Objective of Coco
- detecting non-iconic (or non-canonical perspectives) views of objects
- contectual reasoning between objects
- precise 2D localisation of objects

preliminary hypothesis:
- in order to push research in contextual reasoning, images depicting scenes rather than objects in isolation are necessary
- detailed spatial understanding of object layout will be a core component of scene analysis


### Coco
- 91 common object catagories with 82 of them having more than 5,000 labeled instances
- 2,500,000 labeled instances in 328,000 images
